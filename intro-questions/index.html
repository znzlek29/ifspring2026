        <h1>Introductory Questions & Responses - Andrew Park</h1>
        <li><b>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>My name is Andrew Park, a Freshman in the Communication Design major</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and have been living in South Korea after moving back to the country in 2009.<br> 
            I first came to United States in 2019 as an 8th grade student, and have been studying in the US since.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I believe I have a very small experience in html, and some experience in css and javascript.<br>
            I have listened to some online courses in all three of the languages, but that is still some priliminary knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I hope to learn the details of web design, and using the three langugages - HTML, CSS, JS - to develop a website of my own. <br>
            I also hope to learn and absorb as much as I can of all the skills possible in all three langugaes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I believe that unlike designing for paper, designing for screen requires everything to be user friendly, or at least interactive. <br>
            This is because a screen ultimately requires a user to intract with the elements in the design. The designer has to be mindful <br>
            of this fact and make the design to be easy for the people to use.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I think the website for Riot Games best exemplifies effective design. The elements in the page are minimally spaced, <br>
            which makes it easy for the users to see and navigate themselves into the inner pages. The interactive details - for example, <br>
            when we hover on the buttons it changes the color - add different experiences to the users and makes them want to dive more into <br>
            the website.</li>
            <p> </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en">Riot Games Website</a></p>
        </ul>
        <li><b>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I believe that Epic Games Store website displays effective communication. The buttons are closely located, <br>
            but they are spaced in a way that is easy for the users to see and navigate through the pages, and each element elegantly <br>
            goes together</li>
            <p> </p>
            <p><a href = "https://store.epicgames.com/en-US">Epic Games Store Website</a></p>
        </ul>
        <li><b>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Apple Website works well. It has a great display of the items it sells and in very clean categories. <br>
            Also, as the purpose of a store, the website contains the essense of a shoping website, distinctly guiding the users <br>
            through the purchasing process</li>
            <p> </p>
            <p><a href = "https://www.apple.com/">Apple Official Website</a></p>
        </ul>
