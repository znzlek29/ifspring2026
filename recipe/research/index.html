        <h2>3 Recipe Websites and Critiques</h2>
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li><a href="https://www.maangchi.com/">Maangchi</a>- This website, while it does contain the recipe that I need in an elegant and organized way, the website itself need a lot of improvement. The font looks too mechanic and some of the colors give you discomfort for the eyes. The content of the recipe needs to be downloaded separately. I would like to work differently from this website</li>
            <li><a href="https://mykoreankitchen.com/">My Korean Kitchen</a> - This website conviently has the designs that a website needs. The specific contrast of orange and red as a color are visually satisfying, the instructions are written within the website page and gives it an option to be emailed to a specific email, and it has related recipes tab which the reader could access easily</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/">Korean Bapsang</a> - This website gives you a lot of options to choose from, and each options are organized very well. The recipe page is also well organized with clear instructions and options to choose from. I also like how they group different recipes based on a theme, like new years, to connect different food items with each other</li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <h2>3 Non Recipe Website References</h2>
        
        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/">Epic Games Store</a> - I have already mentioned this website, but I cannot reiterate the orgnization of this workpiece. Each game item is spaced specifically so that it is not to close nor not to far away, and the individual game tabs have a specific organization which is easy for the users to identify which section is which. I overall enjoy this website very much</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Transparent-Steampunk-Vest-Accessories-NO-SEW">Autodesk Instructables: Transparent Steampunk Vest & Accessories (NO SEW!)</a>- This instructions board immediatly draws the attention of the readers through the large image at the beginning of the board showing the end product. I like how the instructions have have images inbetween so that the reders of this website know exactly what is needed to create the same product as the person who made this did. I also like how the writing is organized into specific sections, which adds visiblity and also allows the readers to follow through step by step</li>
            <li><a href="https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/List_of_E.G.O_Gifts">wiki.gg: list of Limbus Company E.G.O Gifts</a>- This I chose specifically because of how the descriptions of each is oriented to the right of each visual, making it easy for the readers to find and red through the ego gits. At the very beginning of each section and subsection, the website also contains a link that we as users can click and get to a specific section of the website. Overall, it is a great website to look for information and find them</li>
